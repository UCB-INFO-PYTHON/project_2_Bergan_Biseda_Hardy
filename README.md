In all almost all sports there is a phenomenon whereby the “home” team typically wins a higher percentage of games than the “away” team. This home-team advantage is predictable over a large enough sample size such that it is a major factor in sports betting. Here we seek to investigate this home-ice advantage for the National Hockey League (“NHL”) in order to quantify it, identify the drivers, and to see where the advantage manifests in various facets of the game. We are interested specifically in the NHL because hockey is known as the “most-random” of the major US sports, making it the least-analyzed sport from the perspective of data science.  There exists a demonstrable difference between the distribution of goals scored at home vs. away.
